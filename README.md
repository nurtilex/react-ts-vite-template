## Introduction

This is a template repository for kickstarting your future projects with a modern tech stack. It provides a robust setup for building React applications with TypeScript, Vite, and essential tools for maintaining code quality and consistency. By using this template, you can save time and focus on developing your project's features.

## Features

- React and TypeScript for building web applications.
- Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.
- Eslint and Prettier configuration for code consistency and formatting.
- Stylelint configuration for consistent CSS and SCSS styling.
- Husky and Lint-staged configuration for pre-commit code checks.
- VSCode settings and recommended extensions for a seamless development experience.
- Import aliases for Vite and TypeScript.
- Feature Sliced Design for organizing your application's code.
- CSS properties sorting to keep your styles neat and organized.
- Imports sorting in TypeScript files for cleaner imports.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.

### Installation

1. Click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on this template.
2. Clone your new repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

3. Change into the project directory.

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

4. Install the project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

This repository offers the basic configuration of the project on the React+TS stack, including pre-configured auxiliary utilities like linters, import sorting, CSS rules sorting, FSD architecture and reduced imports using Vite Aliases

All decisions regarding which technology to use
and how to configure configuration files are made based on subjective views.
In any case, the list of dependencies remained minimal, and everything else was placed in the list of dev dependencies

## Folder Structure

The project structure is configured minimally based on the increasingly popular FSD methodology.

You can learn more on the official [website](https://feature-sliced.design)

## Linting and Formatting

The main linter is "Prettier" with the auxiliary role "Eslint" for "TypeScript" files and "Stylelint" for CSS files.

## VSCode Setup

Added configuration files for VS Code settings and also a list of recommended plugins

## Aliases

Import aliases, also known as path aliases or module aliases, are a feature commonly used in modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects to simplify and organize the way you import modules and dependencies within your code. Import aliases allow you to create custom, easy-to-read shortcuts for frequently used paths, making your import statements cleaner and more maintainable.

## CSS Properties Sorting

CSS properties sorting is a practice in web development that involves arranging the properties within a CSS rule in a specific order for better readability and maintainability. The main idea is to group related properties together and arrange them consistently. Here's a brief explanation:

## Imports Sorting

Imports sorting is a coding practice in JavaScript and TypeScript where import statements in source code are organized and ordered systematically for clarity and maintainability. The primary goal is to make it easier for developers to find and understand dependencies. Here's a brief explanation:
ree to customize this template to include any additional information specific to your project. A well-documented README makes it easier for collaborators and users to understand and contribute to your project. Good luck with your future projects!
